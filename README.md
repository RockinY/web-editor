# Draftjs Demo

This project is not intended as a complete one-stop solution for your desired web-editor. Instead, it is recommended for you to dive into the core drafjs documention and api and build your uniq web editor. Unlike the last-draftjs project. All major plugins are embeded inside the project which makes your modifications much easier.
